information, hand in your resignation\\nLoss of a good friend best of intentions I found\\nTight lipped procrastination\\nYeah later, see you around (Here we go motherfuckers)\\nDo you want to come to a party\\nMy friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30\\nThis things at a frat house but the people are cool there\\nReluctant I followed but I never dreamed there\\nWould be someone there who would catch my attention\\nI wasn\\'t out searching for love or affection\\nSo I paid my 3 and the girls got in free\\nShine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party And then in the backyard some terrible ska band\\nSomeone in the background was doing a keg stand\\nThis place is so lame all these girls look the same\\nAll these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed\\nIn my bed back at home watching TV alone\\nWhere I\\'d put on some porn or have sex on the phone\\nFar from people I hate down from anywhere state\\nTrying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party And then I saw her standing there\\nWith green eyes and long blond hair\\nShe wasn\\'t wearing underwear at least I prayed that\\nShe might be the one maybe we\\'d have some fun\\nMaybe we\\'d watch the sun rise\\nBut that night I learned some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard\\nSome girls try too hard to impress\\nWith the way that they dress\\nWith those things on their chests\\nAnd the things they suggest to me I couldn\\'t believe what this lady was saying\\nThe names she was dropping the games she was playing\\nShe dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly\\'s\\nHow she\\'s down with the Iwise well constructed disguise\\nNow I\\'d rather go dateless than stay here and hate this\\nHer volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless\\nSo I said I\\'d call her but never would bother\\nUntil I got turned down by another girl at a party So when you see her standing there\\nWith green eyes and long blonde hair\\nShe won\\'t be wearing underwear and you\\'ll discover\\nThis girl\\'s not the one and she\\'ll never be fun\\nYou should just turn and run because you\\'ll find out that\\nSome girls try too hard Some girls try too hard\\nSome girls try too hard to impress\\nWith the way that they dress\\nWith those things on their chest\\nAnd the things they suggest to me Some girls try too hard\\nSome girls try too hard I wanna have the same last dream again\\nThe one where I wake up and I\\'m alive\\nJust as the four walls close me within\\nMy eyes are open up with pure sunlight\\nI\\'m the first to know\\nMy dearest friends\\nEven if your hope has burned with time\\nAnything that is dead shall be re-grown\\nAnd your vicious pain, your warning sign\\nYou will be fine hey yo here I am\\nAnd here we go\\nLife\\'s waiting to begin Any type of love it will be shown\\nLike every single tree reach for the sky\\nIf you\\'re gonna to fall\\nI\\'ll let you know\\nThat I will pick you up\\nLike you for I\\nI felt this thing\\nI can\\'t replace\\nWhere everyone was working for this goal\\nWhere all the children left without a trace\\nOnly to come back as pure as gold\\nTo recite this so\\nhey yo here I am\\nAnd here we go\\nLife\\'s waiting to begin\\nTonight\\nhey ohhh here I am\\nAnd here we go\\nLife\\'s waiting to begin\\nTonight\\nhey yo here I am\\nAnd here we go\\nLife\\'s waiting to begin I cannot live\\nI can\\'t breathe\\nUnless

With all of this I know now\\nEverything inside of my head\\nIt all just goes to show how\\nNothing I know changes me at all\\nAgain I waited for this to change instead\\nTo tear the world in two\\nAnother night with her\\nBut I\\'m always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me\\nWe know where we go\\nUse me Holly come on and use me\\nWe go where we know With all of this I feel now\\nEverything inside of my heart\\nIt all just seems to be how\\nNothing I feel pulls at me at all\\nAgain I waited for this to pull apart\\nTo break my time in two\\nAnother night with her\\nBut I\\'m always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me\\nWe know where we go\\nUse me Holly come on and use me\\nWe go where we know She\\'s all I need\\nShe\\'s all I dream\\nShe\\'s all I\\'m always wanting\\nShe\\'s all I need\\nShe\\'s all I dream\\nShe\\'s all I\\'m always wanting you\\nI\\'m always wanting you\\nI\\'m always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me\\nWe know where we go\\nUse me Holly come on and use me\\nWe go where we know She\\'s all I need\\nShe\\'s all I dream\\nShe\\'s all I\\'m always wanting\\nShe\\'s all I need\\nShe\\'s all I dream\\nShe\\'s all I\\'m always wanting you And all again I wait for this\\nTo fill a whole, to shake the sky in two\\nAnother night with her\\nI\\'m always wanting you\\nAnother night with her\\nBut I\\'m always wanting you Been gone a long time I kinda lost my way, can\\'t find you\\nAnd I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season\\nI can try to get by, but every time I start to panic\\nI\\'m a little bit shy, a bit strange and a little bit manic La da da da, da da da da\\nLa da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da\\nLa da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor\\nCut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore\\nI reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand\\nMade it\\'s way through my heart, had fun in the promised land On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles\\nIn a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover\\nCan you figure me out?

I\\'ve been turning it over and over in my mind lately.\\nI\\'ve read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I\\'m through. I\\'ve been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute. I\\'ve wanted that picture more than anything else I know of, except, of course, you yourself.\\nI keep thinking of you, Darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worst possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don\\'t look so good on that subject. But this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess.\\nI\\'ve never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I\\'m completely lost without you, Darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won\\'t be too much longer until I\\'m able to be with you again... and live a sane and normal life. I\\'m sick of always hearing\\nAll the sad songs on the radio\\nAll day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy\\nThat he\\'s lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show\\nWe would stay up all through the night\\nWe would laugh and get high\\nAnd never answer the phone I can\\'t forgive\\nCan\\'t forget\\nCan\\'t give in what went wrong\\n\\'Cause you said this was right\\nYou fucked up my life I\\'m sick of always hearing\\nSappy love songs on the radio\\nThis place is fucking cursed in its plague\\nAnd I can never escape when my heart it explodes I can\\'t forgive\\nCan\\'t forget\\nCan\\'t give in what went wrong\\nCause you said this was right\\nYou fucked up my life I\\'m kicking out fiercely of the world around me\\nWhat went wrong I\\'m kicking Don\\'t wanna hear the static on the TV screen\\nDon\\'t wanna live a life of cellphone memories When did you go missing?\\nWhere did I go wrong?\\nSometimes I just don\\'t know where I belong Save yourself where I was saving\\nWe\\'re not the same, we\\'re two in a million\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days\\nWe\\'ve gone through hell, the battles we fought \\'em\\nWe stood as one, the young and forgotten\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days You\\'re not the only one who grew up feeling scared\\nYou\\'re not the only broken heart gone un-repaired Everyone\\'s gone missing\\nEveryone\\'s done wrong\\nSometimes we both fly too close to the sun Save yourself where I was saving\\nWe\\'re not the same, we\\'re two in a million\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days\\nWe\\'ve gone through hell, the battles we fought \\'em\\nWe stood as one, the young and forgotten\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days You\\'re giving up\\nWe\\'re getting out\\nWe were young and we\\'re not growing up\\nWe\\'re not growing up You\\'re giving up\\nWe\\'re getting out\\nWe were young and we\\'re not growing up\\nWe\\'re not growing up Save yourself where I was saving\\nWe\\'re not the same, we\\'re two in a million\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days\\nWe\\'ve gone through hell, the battles we fought \\'em\\nWe stood as one, the young and forgotten\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days These are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days These are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days Last night it came as a picture\\nWith a good reason, a warning sign\\nThis place is void of all passion\\nIf you can imagine it\\'s easy if you try\\nBelieve me I failed this effort\\nI wrote a reminder this wasn\\'t a vision\\nThis time where are you Houston\\nIs somebody out there will somebody listen Should I go back should I go back should I\\nI feel alone and tired\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nI hope I won\\'t forget you My head is made up of memories\\nMost of them useless delusions\\nThis room is bored of rehearsal\\nAnd sick of the boundaries\\nI miss you so much Should I go back should I go back should I\\nI feel alone and tired\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nThis time I don\\'t want to\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nI feel alone and tired\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nI hope I won\\'t forget you Should I go back should I go back should I\\nI feel alone and tired\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nThis time I don\\'t want to\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nI feel alone and tired\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nI hope I won\\'t forget you Sometimes I wonder where our lives go\\nThey question who we used to be\\nSometimes I feel like I\\'m the oxygen between\\nThe cigarette and gasoline I can\\'t sleep \\'cause what if I dream\\nOf going back to San Diego\\nWe bought a one way ticket\\nSo we could go see the Cure\\nAnd listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot\\nAnd think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)\\nCan\\'t go back to San Diego (can\\'t go back to San Diego) Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh)\\nLate at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh)\\nAbandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors\\nI read the sadness on your face I can\\'t sleep \\'cause what if I dream\\nOf going back to San Diego\\nWe bought a one way ticket\\nSo we could go see the Cure\\nAnd listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot\\nAnd think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)\\nCan\\'t go back to San Diego (can\\'t go back to San Diego) I never needed to hear\\nAll of the pain and the fear\\nYour secrets filled up my ears\\nLike the ocean blue\\nI never wanted to know\\nHow deep these cuts on you go\\nAnd like a river they flow\\nTo the ocean blue Going back to San Diego\\nWe bought a one way ticket\\nSo we could go see the Cure\\nAnd listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot\\nAnd think of every person I ever lost at San Diego (San Diego) (to San Diego)\\nCan\\'t go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can\\'t go back to San Diego) I got no regret right now\\n(I\\'m feeling this)\\nThe air is so cold and numb\\n(I\\'m feeling this)\\nLet me go in her room\\n(I\\'m feeling this)\\nI wanna take off her clothes\\n(I\\'m feeling this) Show me the way to

this time\\nYour smile fades in the summer\\nPlace your hand in mine\\nI\\'ll leave when I wanna Where do we go from here\\nTurn all the lights down now\\nSmiling from ear to ear\\n(I\\'m feeling this)\\nOur breathing has got too loud\\n(I\\'m feeling this) Show me the bedroom floor\\n(I\\'m feeling this)\\nShow me the bathroom mirror\\n(I\\'m feeling this)\\nWere taking this way too slow\\n(I\\'m feeling this)\\nTake me away from here\\n(I\\'m feeling this) Fate fell short this time\\nYour smile fades in the summer\\nPlace your hand in mine\\nI\\'ll leave when I wanna Fate fell
